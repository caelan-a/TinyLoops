# TinyLoops
A React based Audio looper web app

This webapp originally used react as a frontend and employed sockets to talk to a python backend. It was first intended to be used with a raspberry pi to allow physical foot pedal.
Later it was determined that javascript could be used to listen to mic input data which would allow complete generalisability. 
The footpedal could be hooked up to an arduino to talk to the react app either wirelessly, by bluetooth or physical wire.

This project was inspired by a desire to create a lowcost portable loop station.
